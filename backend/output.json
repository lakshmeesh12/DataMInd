    "answer": "The specification for the 150mm thick Aerocon wall for the Intermediate wall in the Future Expansion Area, Handwash, Plate wash, Server room, Battery UPS room, and Cafeteria is as follows:\n\n- **Construction**: Providing and constructing of AAC wall set in adhesive 5mm to 10mm thick or 1:4 cement mortar. It includes a single coat rough cement plaster on both sides of the wall in 1:4 ratio.\n- **Reinforcement**: Minimum 2 nos of 6mm dia MS bars (including tie bars) with 75mm height cement concrete at every 5 courses.\n- **Additional Features**: Rates include scaffolding, curing, RCC lintel at all heights, constructed to true line & plumb, etc., complete as per the Architect's instructions. The rate should be inclusive of masking for fixtures & wooden frames. The wall is to be built till the true ceiling.\n- **Lintel Details**: Rate includes RCC lintel with a lintel overlap length of 300mm to 450mm on both ends, varying based on door size, at necessary heights for doors (lintel at door bottom & top).\n- **Curing**: Curing of blocks to be done to the satisfaction of the Project Manager.\n- **Junction Treatment**: At the junction of RCC structure & block walls, necessary wall hacking and cement slurry to be considered on existing structure joints overlap and finished with POP punning.\n- **Density**: 550-700 kg/m³\n- **Compressive Strength**: 30-50 kg/cm²\n- **Fire Resistance**: Highly fire resistant, able to withstand standard fire for 240 minutes under load.\n- **Standards**: Products have ISI (BIS) norms and marking, conforming to Indian standards, specifically IS 2185 (part 3).\n- **Sound Absorption**: Sound absorbency of airborne sound for 3\" & 4\" walls is 38 to 40 dB.\n- **Mode of Measurement**: Wall will be measured on one side (i.e., Total length of the wall x height of wall {LxH}).\n\nThis information is sourced from the structured data in Source 2, Sheet: INTERIOR.",
